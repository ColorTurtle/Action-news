## Main Goal ##

 - continued practice using Backbonejs;
 - practice with responsive layouts;
 - experiment w/styling the mobile layout in a completely different style;
 - time constraint of 24 hours
 
 
### Challenges ###
 
 - Deadline - working under short time constraint I chose to work with Twitter Bootstrap. While I really like Bootstrap's grid system, when it came to overriding stying it's kind of a pain.
 - Integrating data file - This should have been easy, but it was more challenging than I expected to hook up a local file with the array of article objects. For a real project the data would be called via a server, but for the sake of this I just wanted to use a local file. Good learning experience.
 
### Successes ###

 - I think the overall layout transitions are successful
 - Great resources - Lorempixel.com, Placehold.it and Meettheipsums.com were all great resources for the content and easy to use.
